# Meet Your Special Someone on Virtual Date
"Dating meets gaming in this new way to meet a special someone!  A dating simulation game, Virtual Date allows a player to prepare a fun, interactive date and for other players to then experience the date firsthand.  Choose the right path to someone's heart as you answer tough questions, react quickly to zany circumstances, and even handle an occasional crazy ex that might show up!  Every date is then scored and forwarded to its creator, so that they can gauge whether the player is the perfect match for them.  Avoid the initial awkwardness of online dating by meeting people through Virtual Date!"

# VirtualDate
A blast from the past!  Virtual Date was a personal software project in the realm of entertainment, with the aims of becoming a full-scale product through garnered interest or funding. After contracting out the necessary artwork, I wrote the software for the fully functional prototype, which allowed people to go on a date with each other virtually. After presenting it (along with a modest business plan) at a few industry events, I received warm feedback and some general interest. It was written with a combination of Flash, PHP, and MySQL.
